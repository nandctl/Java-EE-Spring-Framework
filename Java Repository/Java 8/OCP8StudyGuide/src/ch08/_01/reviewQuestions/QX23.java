//// Assume that you have an InputStream whose next bytes are XYZABC. What is

/*
 * H. Not all java.io streams support the mark() operation; therefore, without
 * calling markSupported() on the stream, the result is unknown until runtime.
 * 
 * If the stream does support the mark() operation, then the result would be
 * XYZY, because the reset() operation puts the stream back in the position
 * before the mark() was called, and skip(1) will skip X, and E would be ( It will return a String value of XYZY.)
 * correct. If the stream does not support the mark() operation, a runtime
 * exception would likely be thrown, and G would be correct. Since you donâ€™t
 * know if the input stream supports the mark() operation, H is the only correct
 * choice.
