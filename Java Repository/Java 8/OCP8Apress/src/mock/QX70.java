// Select all the statements that are true about streams (supported in
// java.util.stream.Stream interface)?

// a) Computation on source data is performed in a stream only when the terminal
// operation is initiated, i.e., streams are “lazy” (+)

// b) Once a terminal operation is invoked on a stream, it is considered
// consumed and cannot be used again (+)

// c) Once a stream is created as a sequential stream, its execution mode cannot
// be changed to parallel stream (and vice versa)

// d) If the stream source is modified when the computation in the stream is
// being performed, then it may result in unpredictable or erroneous results (+)
