//A breadth-first traversal is when all elements of the same level, or distance from the
//starting path, are visited before moving on to the next level. On the other hand, a depth first
//traversal is when each elementâ€™s entire path, from start to finish, is visited before moving
//onto another path on the same level. Both walk() and find() use depth-first traversals

// Files.walk -> depth-first
// Files.find -> depth-first
