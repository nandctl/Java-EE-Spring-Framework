//B. Since no locale is specified, the code tries to find a bundle matching the default
//locale. While none of the resource bundles match English United States, two do match
//the language English. 

// The Java class one is used since it is present. Since the Java
//resource bundle for English doesnâ€™t have a key wheels, we go up to the parent resource
//bundle. The default Java resource bundle does have the key wheels with the value 4, so
//Option B is correct.
