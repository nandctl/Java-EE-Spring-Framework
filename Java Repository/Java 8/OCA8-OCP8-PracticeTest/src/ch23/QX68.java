// Which two conditions best describe a thread that appears to be active but is
// perpetually stuck and never able to finish its task? (Choose two.)


//A. Deadlock 
//B. Livelock (+)
//C. Loss of precision
//D. Out of memory error
//E. Race condition
//F. Starvation (+)

// A deadlock and livelock both result in threads that cannot complete a task
// but only in a livelock do the threads appear active

// starvation is caused by a single active thread that is perpetually denied access to a shared resource or lock
