// We are running a library. Patrons select books by name. They get at the back
// of the check- out line. When they get to the front, they scan the bookâ€™s
// ISBN. The checkout system finds the book based on this number and marks the
// book as checked out. Of these choices, which data structures best represent
// the line to check out the book and the book lookup to mark it as checked out,
// respectively?

// A. ArrayDeque, TreeMap (+)
// B. ArrayDeque, TreeSet
// C. ArrayList, TreeMap
// D. ArrayList, TreeSet
